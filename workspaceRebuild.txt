If you have to restart a workspace here are the steps to get
going again based on a FRC example project.

This deals with a lot of the project configuration so is
an easy way to get the build settings right then pull down the
current repo code.

This assumes the workspace is at
c:\windriver\workspace
Git Bash is the shell used (mingw based)
And your system has network connectivity to github.com

From WindRiver Workbench,

File->New->Example
   Choose M+ VxWorks Downloadable Kernel Module Sample Project
   Pick an appropriate  project like FRC Simple Robot Template
   click finish

Then Right click the workspace and rename (F2) it to
the github repo (like minibuild2013)

Then you can use the github command line and enter the following commands
to connect the sample project to the git hub repo.


cd /c/windriver/workspace/

#  cd <yourreponame>  
cd minibuild2013

rm MyRobot.cpp  # since we are going to pull the current from github

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/phoenixfrc/minibuild2013.git
git fetch
git checkout -t origin/master
git status
